### This serves the purpose to document important DAX functions that I have used in various dashboards and BI reports. 


##### USERPRINCIPALNAME(), USERNAME()

##### RLSP: manage data accesss and personalize dashboards (who can see what information)

##### ADDCOLUMNS()--returns input table appended with the selected columns from another table; SELECTCOLUMNS()--returns the selected columns from another table as a new table
##### SUMMARIZE() -- returns a summary table for the requested total over a set of groups (groupby); resulting in a table w/ columns, not measures 
##### time-intelligence series analysis: TOTALYTD() 

##### design layout: take advantage of bookmark function to tell stories.
